    The Great Lakes: a massive fresh water system that comprises one-fifth of the world’s fresh water. Over 27 million people call these lakes' shorelines home and rely on their climate and weather stabilizing abilities. But like so many ecosystems, the Great Lakes are now vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

    All five Great Lakes–Michigan, Superior, Erie and Huron–have experienced a decrease in annual maximum ice coverage. Since 1973, the overall ice coverage has decreased by over 25%, with a continued downward trend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. 
  </p>
  <article>
    <p>
      Last winter, the Great Lakes experienced one of the lowest maximum ice coverage on the Great Lakes, with only 16% ice coverage at its peak.

      “The unseasonably high temperatures last winter really hindered ice growth,” said Joseph Phillips, NOAA and Marquette National Weather Service Technical Operations Coordination Meteorologist.

      This year, ice has returned to normal levels, at over 50% maximum coverage so far, but this huge fluctuation continues to worry climate researchers.

      “Even with this extreme variability, we have been monitoring ice accumulation since 1973 and the overall trend is downward, about 5% less ice per decade,” said Jennifer Day, NOAA-GLERL Director of Communication. “So even though on average we are seeing less ice, each winter and how the ice will develop could be a lot or a little. We can not really predict ice coverage in years to come because of this annual variation.”

    Despite this high variation year to year, the trend is clear: long-term ice coverage in the Great Lakes is on the decline.
  </p>
</article>
<h2>Why does ice matter?</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
    Ice coverage acts as a critical buffer against the impacts of hazardous weather conditions. In the Great Lakes, ice coverage prevents lake-effect snow events, Arctic air outbreaks, among other extreme conditions, according to NOAA. 
  </p>
  </article> 
  <article>
    <p>
      Declining ice coverage also impacts the ecosystem of the Great Lakes region. Fish species like Lake Whitefish, which rely on heavy winter ice cover, have declined in population in recent years. This fish also generates the largest income for Great Lakes commercial fisheries in the United State and Canada, so declining populations are a concern for climate researchers. 
  </p>

    Beyond storms and ecosystem decline, the large fluctuations in annual ice coverage has an effect on the spring algae bloom in the area. Less ice and a shorter ice season can cause an earlier bloom of harmful algae, like cyanobacteria, which thrives in warmer waters with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide. Cyanobacteria, or “green-blue algae” is toxic for humans and wildlife, according to NOAA. 
    </p>
  </article>

    <p>
      Although it's difficult to predict the future of Great Lakes ice entirely, long-term ice coverage data has allowed scientists at NOAA and the EPA to prepare for ecological, health and weather events caused by an overall declining Great Lakes ice in the years to come.
