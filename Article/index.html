    The Great Lakes, one-fifth of the world’s freshwater, has been vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

    According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the maximum ice coverage varies significantly year-over-year. All five Great Lakes have experienced a decrease in maximum ice coverage since 1973, but it’s only been statistically significant for Lake Superior.

<h2>Why does ice matter?</h2>
  <article>
    Ice coverage acts as a critical buffer against the impacts of hazardous weather conditions. In the Great Lakes, ice coverage prevents lake-effect snow events, Arctic air outbreaks, among other conditions, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
  </article> 
  <p>
  <article>
    Declining ice coverage also impacts the ecosystem of the Great Lakes region. Fish species like Lake Whitefish, which rely on heavy winter ice cover, have declined in population since recent years. This fish also generates the largest income for Great Lakes commercial fisheries in the United State and Canada, so declining populations are a concern for researchers. 
  </p>

    <article>
    Beyond storms and ecosystem decline, the large fluctuations in annual ice coverage has an effect on the spring algae bloom in the area. Less ice and a shorter ice season can cause an earlier bloom of harmful algae, like cyanobacteria, which thrives in warmer waters with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide. Cyanobacteria, or “green-blue algae” is toxic for humans and wildlife, according to NOAA.
